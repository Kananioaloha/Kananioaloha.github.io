    "text": "Perdicted vs Verified Tides (Jan 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive scattor plot compares NOAA’s predicted average lowest tides with the actual observed tides in Hilo during January 2023. The two lines follow almost the same pattern, showing that tide forecasts are highly accurate for Bayfront. Small gaps between the lines reflect real ocean conditions such as wind, swell, or rain runoff that make the observed tide slightly higher or lower than the prediction.\nWhat this code does: This R code reads the January 2023 tide data, renames the first column as datetime, and arranges the measurements in time order. It then uses ggplot() with geom_line() to plot the predicted and observed tide heights as two smooth lines. Custom colors and labels are added with scale_color_manual() and labs(). Finally, ggplotly() turns the plot into an interactive graph so viewers can hover, zoom, and explore how closely the predicted and actual tides match.\nConclusion The 2023 tide patterns in Hilo clearly show how closely our ocean rhythms follow the moon. Full and new moons — especially the August supermoons — created the biggest tide swings of the year, with higher high tides and much lower low tides. Quarter moons brought the opposite: smaller, calmer tides that align with safer diving conditions. By layering tide observations, moon-phase calendars, and interactive visualizations, this dashboard highlights the strong connection between lunar cycles and daily coastal conditions that fishers, divers, and local families rely on. The predicted vs. observed comparison also shows that NOAA’s forecasts for Hilo Bayfront are highly accurate, making them a valuable tool for planning fishing trips, beach days, and coastal safety decisions. Overall, understanding these patterns strengthens our kilo — our ability to observe, anticipate, and make decisions based on natural cycles. These insights can support everything from everyday fishing practices to long-term coastal planning and environmental conservation and education in Hawaiʻi."

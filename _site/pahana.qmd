**Hauʻoli Makahiki Hou!**\
The rising of **Makaliʻi** at sunset marks **Makahiki**, a season under **Lono** focused on peace, harvest, games, and community.\
It usually runs mid-November through late January/February with the rainy season.

Makahiki traditions include hoʻokupu (offerings), ʻauhau (tribute), and games like heihei kūkini, mokomoko, hākōkō, pūhenehene, and kōnane.\
It’s also a time to rest the land and strengthen relationships.
